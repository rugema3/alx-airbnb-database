# ALX Airbnb Database Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum, focusing on database design and implementation for an Airbnb-like application. The goal is to create a well-structured relational database that can support the core functionality of a property rental platform.

## Description
The Airbnb Database Project involves designing a comprehensive database schema that models the relationships between users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, and messages in a property rental application. The project emphasizes:

- Database design principles and best practices
- Entity-relationship modeling
- Normalization techniques (up to 3NF)
- SQL schema creation with appropriate constraints
- Data integrity and referential integrity

The database is designed to support key features such as:
- User registration and authentication
- Property listing and management
- Booking and reservation system
- Payment processing
- Review and rating system
- Messaging between hosts and guests

## Learning Objectives
Through this project, students will:
- Apply database design principles to model complex systems
- Create entity-relationship diagrams to visualize database structure
- Implement normalization to optimize database efficiency
- Define database schemas with appropriate constraints
- Prepare for real-world database implementation
